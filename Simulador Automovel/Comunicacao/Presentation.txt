For only 600 USD I am building myself a full car , with 6 speed H shifter and reverse, sequential shifter, 10 bit analogic handbreak and analogic clutch break and gas pedals, engine start key with 3 positions, master shutdown, buttons for horn and lights and camera and Esc and Enter... rotary encoder for Up and Down keys, leds for RPM, red leds for loosing traction on Front and on Back, blue leds for ABS and TC, Wind controlled by speed (2 strong hairdryers), 10bit 900º forcefeedback wheel (350W motor from an old mixer) and... :D the car pitches and rols 26º (wich is a lot, scary) front/back left/right (2x800W drills) and has 2 seatbelts that compress you when you break or turn hard.
I might post a tutorial on how to do it, and release all the software I developed for this. It's a killer for those companies selling this king of stuff.




This is one of the screens of the software I'm doing. On the top half you can «preview» the buttons, leds, pitch, roll, steering wheel, shift. On the lower left you can view the data that is being red from AC. On the lower right you can configure some things on the fly (there are more screens where you can configure a lot more)




The electronics, based on a Arduino Mega (35$) + 4 triacs (35$) + 8 relays (10$). You just have to connect the wires (make no mistakes!)
